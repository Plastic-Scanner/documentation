## Current issues

* There is no clear marking on the pcb which revision it is.
* Add silkscreen labels to connectors.
* LED3 (indicator for 2.5v reference) is breaking the reference voltage cause it is drawing too much current.
* Pin 0 is used for the reset of the LED driver, but if there is Serial communication it is on pin 0 and 1 so it resets the led driver. Jure made a fix by desoldering r24 and soldering a wire from pin 2 to the led drive side of pad r24.
* Mounting holes are not perfectly square
* Arduino reset button is hard to reach

## How to Build Development Board 2.0

1. solder power components
   1. measure if you get the correct values
2. solder ADC components
   1. see if you can communicate through SPI and I2C with the board
3. Solder Analog frontend
   1. See if you measure differences with a tv remote
4. Solder IR Leds
   1. See if LEDs draw the right amounth of power
   2. use a phone camera to see if it is working

## How to Verify correct working of Development Board 2.0

Run the selftest firmware with 
1. a piece of alumimun
   1. Expected measurements: 
2. a piece of (white teflon)
   1. Expected measurements: 
3. a plastic red coca cola bottle cap
   1. Expected measurements:
