# AED group - June 2022
The AED group is a group of students from the TU Delft that working on the plastic scanner. (Gigi Bouman, Markus Glavind, Justè Motuzaité, Jeppe Piersma,Dawn Verkerk) 
Their focus was to redesign the embodiment of the plastic scanner.

# PCB analysis Jitter - September 2022
The people from Jitter.company did an analysis on the development board 2.1. they looked at the PCB and the schematics. They found some small errors in the schematics and some improvements for the PCB. The improvements for the PCB are not necessary for the development board 2.1, but they are useful for the development board 2.2. The improvements are: decoupling capacitor, differential pairing, and some routing strategies.

# Analog frontend study Dylan - May 2023
Dylan had a look at the analog frontend of the development board 2.1. The setup with the transimpedance amplifier (TIA) looks quite robust. some resistors should be speced with a low tolerance so the readings are linear.

# Thesis Queena - June 2023
Queena worked on the Characterisation of the LEDs and InGaAs detector of the handheld plastic scanner as her applied physics thesis. She did a lot of measurements on the LEDs and the InGaAs detector of the development board 2.1., as well as made the comparisment to industry standard spectroscopes.
