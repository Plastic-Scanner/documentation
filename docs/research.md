Original file: [link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337868860_Identification_of_Plastic_Types_Using_Discrete_Near_Infrared_Reflectance_Spectroscopy)  
Identification of Plastic Types Using Discrete Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy by Armin and Bernard. This thesis is the basis of the plastic scanner. It shows that it is possible to identify plastics with a NIR spectrometer. The thesis also shows that the plastic scanner is a good alternative for the current methods of plastic identification.

Auto translated file: [link](files/plasticscanner-review-auto-translated.pdf)  
The people from Jitter.company did an analysis on the development board 2.1. they looked at the PCB and the schematics. They found some small errors in the schematics and some improvements for the PCB. The improvements for the PCB are not necessary for the development board 2.1, but they are useful for the . The improvements are: decoupling capacitor, differential pairing, and some routing strategies.

Original file: [link](files/PlasticScanner_Master_Thesis_Markus_Gustav.pdf)  
Markus and Gustav dedicated their industrial engineering master to the next step of the Plastic Scanner. They took the basis of the AED group and build upon this. Making it production ready together with a market and size analysis.

Original file: [link](files/DB2.1_Systemstudy_analog_frontend.pdf)  
Dylan had a look at the analog frontend of the development board 2.1. The setup with the transimpedance amplifier (TIA) looks quite robust. some resistors should be speced with a low tolerance so the readings are linear.

<img src="/img/research/thesis-queena.png" alt="" width="300"/>

Original file: [link](files/ScriptieC3.0_PlasticScanner_QRijke.pdf)  
Queena worked on the Characterisation of the LEDs and InGaAs detector of the handheld plastic scanner as her applied physics thesis. She did a lot of measurements on the LEDs and the InGaAs detector of the development board 2.1., as well as made the comparisment to industry standard spectroscopes.

# Data analysis Hendrik - April 2023 (ongoing)
Hendrik (dataworm on discord) is contantly looking for the best methods to analyse and interprete the measurements coming from the plastic scanner.
