The fact that you are reading this page already makese you cool ðŸ˜Ž. Now it is time to get you all suited up for development. To make things easy we chose some specific platforms to enable collaberative working.

We use the following things:

* [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.eu/products/fusion-360/overview) - We use Fusion360 as a tool to do 3D modelling.
* [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), The main website runs on wordpress, easy to add content!
* [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), for documentation
* [GitHub](https://github.com/), for version control of software, firmware, hardware and documentation
