# Mechanical Assembly

The mechanical assembly is quite straight forward. All you need to are the following two steps:

1. Print the top cover plate (link), this can be printed quite rough, if it fits, it fits.
2. Print the sensor separator (link), the best is to print this in the highest quality, since it is quite a small part.
3. Press the sensor separator into the hole of the coverplate.
4. Info for screws
