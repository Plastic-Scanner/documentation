Welcome to the Plastic Scanner - a handheld device, which can identify five most common types of plastics. 
It is used for recycling, sorting and separating different kinds of plastics and our aim is to make this process
easier and accessible to everyone!

<!-- Maybe expand on plastic sorting and waste management here? Also mention which plastic polymer types we handle/there are? -->

This is a technical documentation about the scanner, while there is more information about the project on our website [plasticscanner.com](https://plasticscanner.com). The project is open source which means that all the schematics and source code are publicly available and that you are invited to study, modify and contribute to it!
