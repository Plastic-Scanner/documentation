Welcome to the Plastic Scanner - a handheld device, which can identify five most common type of plastics.
It is used for sorting plastic waste based on their material (plastic polymer type/family), which is a crucial step in recycling and solving the plastic pollution problem.

<!-- since mixing different plastic polymers prevents recycling successfuly.
plastic waste recycling, where it is crucial to separate different kind of plastic polymers plastic waste according to their plastic polymer type, which is a crucial step in plastic recycling. -->

Welcome to the Plastic Scanner - a device for identifying different types of plastic.
Separating and sorting of waste plastics is crucial, since mixing different kinds of plastic resins ruins the recycling process. While there are different
approaches to this problem, our aim is to develop a low-cost handheld scanner which can be used everywhere also in non-industrial informalwaste plants in LMIC countries? sth like that.

Welcome to the Plastic Scanner - a handheld scanner, which can identify five most common type of plastics.
Recycling the plastic is good, but mixing different kinds of plastic during that process is bad. The plastic scanner aims to make this process easier, more affordable and available in every part of the world.

Welcome to the Plastic Scanner! 
This project aims to develop a plastic scanner which can be used for sorting waste plastics by identifying the most common plastic resin types. While there
are existing solutions they are mostly bulky, expensive and inaccesible to informal plastic recyclers in low-income countries - and we're trying to address that.

This is a technical documentation about the scanner, while there is more information about the project on our website [plasticscanner.com](https://plasticscanner.com). The project is open source which means that all the schematics and source code are publicly available and that you are invited to study, modify and contribute to it!
