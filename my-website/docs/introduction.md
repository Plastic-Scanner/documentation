## Introduction

Welcome to the Plastic Scanner - a device for identifying different types of plastic for low-cost sorting and recycling of plastic waste. 
> TODO: how to forumlate in 1-2 sentences - a device which can identify which type of plastic is the scanned object from. E.g. you scan a shampoo bottle and it tells you which plastic type it is, e.g. PP.

This is a technical documentation about the scanner itself, while the website [plasticscanner.com](https://plasticscanner.com) contains more general information about the project and its history, scope and future plans.

The project is open source which means all the schematics and source code are publicly available and you are welcome to contribute, study and modify it! Read more about this on CONTRIBUTING page. Together we can fight plastic better!
