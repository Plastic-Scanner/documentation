# Plastic sorting

To create valuable, high-quality products from recycled plastic,
sorting based on plastic-type is essential (Ruj et al., 2015).
Different types of plastic have different melting temperatures
and not sorting plastic would result in unknown and mixed
material properties and partially burned or degraded plastic.
This can be compared to metal recycling where stainless steel,
copper and normal steel are each sorted accordingly. Current
sorting methods for plastic recycling can range from very basic
to very complex. A breakdown of the different sorting methods
is displayed in figure 2.6 (Wisse, 2018).
Most sorting methods separate their inflow in a binary manner.

Plastic falls either in group A or in group B . For example,
separating plastics that float from plastics that sink. This is a
workable method if the inflow of types of plastic is known, or
if there is a continuous inflow of plastic. In informal recycling
there is no foresight about the types of plastics that are entering
and fluctuations in the inflow make binary sorting methods
difficult and slow. For these situations, optical sorting methods
are more suitable, since they make it possible to distinguish
multiple materials at once (Ruj et al., 2015). Within optical
sorting, infrared sorting is the most suitable method. It has the
advantage that a machine interprets the plastic type instead of a
human, making the sorting more objective and eliminating the
requirement of training and previous knowledge about plastic
recognition. More information about plastic and its sorting
techniques can be found in appendix II (Plastic).
