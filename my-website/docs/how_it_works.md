# How it works

The plastic scanner allows you to scan an object (like a shampoo bottle) and identify its plastic type using an approach called **discrete near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy**. Sounds like scientific gibberish? It basically means flashing some kind od light to a plastic sample, measuring its reflection and doing some scientific abracadabra with it. The point is, it allows distinguishing between five most common plastic resins: PET, HDPE, PE, PVC, PP and PS in an affordable, pocket-size manner.

<!-- WARNING: there's an inconsistency between description and image of which resins can we identify. HDPE/LDPE? -->

## Discrete NIR spectroscopy

By shining light to a surface (e.g. a plastic sample), some of it will be absorbed and some of it will be reflected. The amount of reflected light, depends on material's structure and light's wavelength. Measuring the *reflectance* at various wavelengths gives a *spectrum* which provides all sorts of useful information about the measured object. And this is, brutaly simplified, the essence of **spectroscopy**.

Visible light is only a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum and performing spectroscopy in the near-infrared region makes it **NIR** - **N**ear **I**nf**R**ared. It contains the electromagnetic (EM) wavelengths between 780 nm to 2500 nm, which is the region between visible and IR light.
