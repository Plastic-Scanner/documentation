# How it works

The plastic scanner allows you to scan an object, e.g. a shampoo bottle, and identify it's plastic polymer type. While there are multiple ways of doing this, we use an optical approach called **discrete near-infrared spectroscopy**, since it allows us to do low-cost and affordable solution (see "Theoretical foundations" for more info).

IMAGE OF THE CONCEPT - OBJECT + SCANNER + PLASTIC TYPES BINS

Currently, five of the most common plastic polymers can be identified: PET, PE, PVC, PP, PS. Each of those has a significant NIR spectrum.
The scanner measures the reflectance of (near-infrared) light at several specific wavelengths

The hardware contains 8 IR LED diodes with specific wavelengths and a photodetector. Scanning process is flashing each lead in sequence and reading out the reflection of light at that wavelength- obtaining a spectroscopy spectrum profile thingy.

> Let's make a GIF illustrating the big picture / use case - e.g. hold the device in your hand, take a piece of plastic trash, like a cola bottle or sth, scan it ,it tells you which type of plastic it is, throw it in the correct sorting bin. Then illustrate why sorting matters - making 3d printing filament or whatever.
