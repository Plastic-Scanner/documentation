# How it works

Overview of the scanner - use case, briefly about plastic sorting and waste management, intro to the scanner hw + software (block diagram)

The plastic scanner we're making is a handheld device, which allows you to scan a plastic object like a coca-cola bottle for example and it tells you which kind of plastic it is made of. This kind of device is useful in plastic recycling facilities for workers to be able to quickly and reliably separate plastic waste.


Let's make a GIF illustrating the big picture / use case - e.g. hold the device in your hand, take a piece of plastic trash, like a cola bottle or sth, scan it ,it tells you which type of plastic it is, throw it in the correct sorting bin. Then illustrate why sorting matters - making 3d printing filament or whatever.
