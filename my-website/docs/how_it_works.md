# How it works

The plastic scanner allows you to scan an object, e.g. a shampoo bottle, and identify it's plastic type. While there are multiple ways of doing this, we use an optical approach called **discrete near-infrared spectroscopy** which allows distinguishing between five most common plastic resins: PET, HDPE, PE, PVC, PP and PS. See ["Theoretical foundations"](theory.md) for more information.

<!-- The scanner flashes LEDs (with specific wavelengths) onto the plastic sample and measures reflectance. Each plastic resin has different reflectance (NIR) spectrum due to chemical bonds and light reflecting and all that shit. -->

<!-- The hardware contains 8 IR LED diodes with specific wavelengths and a photodetector. Scanning process is flashing each lead in sequence and reading out the reflection of light at that wavelength- obtaining a spectroscopy spectrum profile thingy. -->
