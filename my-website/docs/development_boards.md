# Revision history

This page is made to show which previous versions have been made. It gives you an idea where we came from, what we changed and what worked and what didn't.  

## ReReMeter 

<img src="/img/developmentboards/reremeter.jpg" alt="reremeter" width="200"/>

The Plastic Scanner project started out as a fork of the ReReMeter. The ReReMeter already contains most of the critical parts of the Plastic Scanner, It is an STM32 based board that can flash infrared LEDs sequentially and measure the reflectance with an InGaAs sensor.
