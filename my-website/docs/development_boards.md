| ----------- | ----------- |
| ðŸ“† Release date| April 2020 |
| ðŸ¦„ People                  | Jerry de Vos       |
| ðŸ”— documentation   | Can be found [here](https://github.com/arminstr/reremeter)        |
| âŒš Time  |  6 months |
| ðŸŽ‰ The Good  | - Separation between sensing and processing <br></br> - Bigger components, easier to solder <br></br> - Testpads for debugging <br></br> - Fool proof assembly <br></br> - Qwicc connector to easily add display|
| ðŸ‘¹ The Bad  | - Missing button for interaction <br></br> - Bad schematics |

## ReReMeter 

<img src="/img/developmentboards/reremeter.jpg" alt="reremeter" width="200"/>

The Plastic Scanner project started out as a fork of the ReReMeter. The ReReMeter already contains most of the critical parts of the Plastic Scanner, It is an STM32 based board that can flash infrared LEDs sequentially and measure the reflectance with an InGaAs sensor.

| ðŸ“† Release date| December 2019 |
| ðŸ¦„ People                  | Armin straller and Bernhard Gessler       |
| ðŸ”— documentation   | Can be found [here](https://oshwlab.com/jerzeek/nir-spectroscope)        |
| âŒš Time  | 6 months |
| ðŸŽ‰ The Good  | - Board was small and compact <br></br>- Good enough to prove principle and write a paper about|
| ðŸ‘¹ The Bad  | - Board was difficult to replicate due to the small 0402 components. <br></br>   - Board required a computer to work |
