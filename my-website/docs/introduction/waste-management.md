# Waste management
Most of the mismanaged plastic waste is concentrated in
Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC) (Jambeck et al.
2015, p. 770). It is vital to get a better understanding of their
local waste management. To do so, a broad literature study
was conducted. This research was supplemented with four
semi-structured interviews with people working at informal
recycling facilities in LMIC. 
These people were:
- Tita, Indonesia, running a recycling business in Surabaya.
- Manduku, Kenya, head of Precious Plastic workspace Kisii.
- Prad, India, former Precious Plastic engineer from Delhi.
- Debrah and Mitchell, Curacao, initiating plastic recycling in
Willemstad.

Qualitative insights from past field trips to waste management
in the Maldives and Mauritius completed the research and
provided a holistic overview. The above combination of
literature study, interviews and field trips led to the following
insights:
Although plastic waste management in LMIC differs from
country to country, there are some big differences between
LMIC and countries where mismanaged waste is low. The
key difference is the governmental role in waste management
being much smaller or non-existent in LMIC (Sida, 2004).
Countries either have a formal recycling infrastructure or an
informal recycling infrastructure. In places where informal
waste management infrastructure is dominant, there is a
higher chance of mismanaged plastic waste (Jambeck et al.
2015, p. 770). In an informal setting, waste management is
not monitored by any form of government, individuals start
recycling by themselves and often do not pay taxes (Sida,
2004). As an example, an informal plastic recycling plant is
shown in figure 2.1.

Research by Nandy et al.(2015, p. 177) concluded that the
recycling industry in India is informal and quite mature, all
actors having their own defined role and specific waste stream
they cover. Waste items pass through the hands of many
individuals that each pick out a specific material. This was
confirmed by interviewee Prad (personal communication,
September 18, 2020), and interviewee Tita (personal
communication, September 18, 2020). Research from Mutha
et al.(2006, p. 238) highlights that most recycling units in
India have a small budget, and can be described as informal
recycling. Their analysis of plastic concluded that 83% of the
plastic products used in India consist of PE, PP, PVC, or PS
and that PVC will slowly be replaced by PE or PP.

More recent facts on plastic usage in the European Union
confirm a similar usage pattern, where 73% of the plastic
used in the European Union is made from PE, PP, PVC, PET,
and PS (Plastics Europe, 2019). An overview can be found in
figure 2.2. Except for PVC, a similar usage pattern was found
in Trinidad and Tobago by Millette et al. (2019).

Research in Kenya by Oyake-Ombis et al. (2015, p. 192) found
that economical aspects are the main drivers to start recycling
within the informal sector. This was partly confirmed by
interviewee Manduku (personal communication, September
17, 2020) who owns a Precious Plastic recycling workspace
in Kisii(-Kenya) (figure 2.3), but also highlighted the
sustainability aspect of his recycling workspace.
There is a high demand for this kind of workspaces and each
week a new workspace is set up by different people around the
world.

The interviews and field research gave an overview of the
recycling infrastructure in the informal sector, which consists
of the following stages:


:::info stages in recycling
Collecting - cleaning - sorting - shredding - producing.
:::

The interviewees acknowledged the difficulty in sorting and
identifying plastics. Often this is done by hand, where the
person needs to find the resin identification code on the product
and place it in the appropriate bin. This can be seen in figures
2.4 and 2.5. The workspaces of the people interviewed were
very interested in improving their sorting and identification
process. More information about the context can be found in
appendix III (Anywhere)
The above problems encountered by the recycling spaces
specify the research question: which resources can be
developed to accelerate the sorting process for plastic waste
management in the informal sector?
