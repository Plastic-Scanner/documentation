The point is, it allows distinguishing between the five most common plastic resins: PET, HDPE, PE, PVC, PP and PS in an affordable, pocket-size manner.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"introduction":{"id":"introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Welcome to the Plastic Scanner - a handheld device, which can identify five most common types of plastics.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"overview/infrared":{"id":"overview/infrared","title":"Infrared","description":"Infrared sorting works by shining IR light on a plastic object"},"overview/plastic-sorting":{"id":"overview/plastic-sorting","title":"Plastic sorting","description":"To create valuable, high-quality products from recycled plastic,"},"overview/waste-management":{"id":"overview/waste-management","title":"Waste management","description":"Most of the mismanaged plastic waste is concentrated in"},"theory":{"id":"theory","title":"Theoretical foundations","description":"Overview of plastic identification approaches, NIR basics, discrete vs MEMS etc."}}}')}}]);
