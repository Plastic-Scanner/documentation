The point is, it allows distinguishing between the five most common plastic resins: PET, HDPE, PE, PVC, PP and PS in an affordable, pocket-size manner.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"introduction":{"id":"introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Welcome to the Plastic Scanner - a handheld device, which can identify five most common types of plastics.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"nerdy-on-infrared":{"id":"nerdy-on-infrared","title":"More in depth","description":"datasheets of LED\'s"},"notes":{"id":"notes","title":"Notes on development","description":"Optics setup"},"revision_history":{"id":"revision_history","title":"Revision history","description":"This page is made to show which previous versions have been made.
